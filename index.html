          About my Self
        </h1>

        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
          <p class="mb-0">
            My name is Barr. Sonny Ewule. I am from Oduoha in Emohua LGA. I am a
            legal <br />practitioner and I have been practicing law in Rivers
            State for 30years now, having been called to Bar in 1992. I believe
            Emohua needs proper, capable, mature and experienced representation.
            We must ensure that Emohua's representation at the Assembly
            continues to be PDP. My interest in the race is borne out of a
            desire to continue to render service to my people in this capacity
            as I have always done, to ensure that the voice of Emohua is heard
            and heard clearly. We have a duty to our generation and those unborn
            to make sure we leave Emohua better than we met it. As a legislator,
            I will do my bit to initiate bills with direct bearing on the lives
            of my people in particular, and Rivers people in general. I will
            initiate and support policies capable of providing a better standard
            of life for Emohua indigenes and the state at large. My priority
            will be to look at issues with direct impact on the welfare and
            socioeconomic status of my people. Addressing issues of poor formal
            education and increasing rate of unemployment in my constituency,
            are foremost on my list of priorities concerning the welfare of my
            people. I would introduce a bill for the establishment of vocational
            institutes to reduce unemployment and give our youths some sense of
            belonging. I will partner with the executive arm to see how schools
            in Emohua could be upgraded to ensure a better learning environment
            with greater potential for capacity building. I believe I have what
            it takes to represent my people. I am ready, prepared and able to
            deliver on all my promises.
